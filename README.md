## 👩‍💻 Denise Behrmann | Data Analyst & Cybersecurity Learner

I'm Denise — I have a background in science and QA testing, with experience leading data evaluation teams and working across industries. I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate and created a full R case study using Fitbit data. Currently studying for CompTIA Network+ Certification, and learning practical cyber skills at tryhackme.com - you can follow my progress [here](https://tryhackme.com/p/denisebehrmann).

I’m building a tech-focused career and portfolio that reflect my analytical mindset and love of hands-on learning. I’m especially interested in remote work.
