## 👩‍💻 Denise Behrmann | Data Analyst & Cybersecurity Learner

Greetings, I'm Denise — originally from Gemany based in Ireland since 2011. I have a background in science and QA testing, with experience leading data evaluation teams and working across industries. I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate and created a full R case study using Fitbit data. I am now studying for CompTIA Network+, with a plan to progress to Security+.

I’m building a tech-focused career and portfolio that reflect my analytical mindset and love of hands-on learning. I’m especially interested in remote work (partly so I can care for my chronically ill cat 🐾).
